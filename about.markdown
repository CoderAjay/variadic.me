## About me

I am a student of information systems design at Lund University, Sweden. I also work part time as a software developer at [Bool Nordic AB][bool]. Currently on my third and last year of studies, I work on a few projects of my own when time allows it. I have a fixation with programming languages and I've spent quite some time trying a lot of them out. My view is that each one widens your understanding by showing a problem and solution from a slightly different perspective. Some of the ones that had the strongest impact on me are Haskell, Clojure, Python, as well as books such as [The Little Schemer][tls].

This blog will feature everything from opinionated articles on development practices to basic write ups of small time projects in whatever technologies I got worked up about at the moment. There is often a serious lack of material on the step just between learning a language and being able to build advanced applications in it, and that's one of the areas I'll be aiming for in my posts. The source code for this site is [available for reference on github][variadicgh].

Feel free to contact me at <erik@variadic.me> or check out my profile on [Careers 2.0][careers]. I enjoy emails. And cats.

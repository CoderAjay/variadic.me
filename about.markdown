## About me

I am a student of information systems design at Lund University, Sweden. Currently taking a break from my third year studies, I work on a few projects of my own. I like Haskell, Clojure, Python, in that order, but I also have some experience in Java and C#. I work as a part time lab instructor and mentor at my department.

This blog will probably just feature basic write ups of small time projects in whatever technologies I got worked up about at the moment. There is often a serious lack of material on the step just between learning a language and being able to build advanced applications in it, and that's the area I'll be aiming for in my posts. The source code for this site is [available for reference on github][variadicgh].

Feel free to contact me at <erik@variadic.me>. I enjoy emails. And cats.
